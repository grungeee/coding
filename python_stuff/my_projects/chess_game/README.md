## Pawn (P)

Pawns move forward one square at a time, but on their first move, they have the option to move two squares forward[1][4]. They capture diagonally one square ahead[1][5]. When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece except a King[1][2].

## Rook (R)

Rooks move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, as long as there are no pieces obstructing their path[1][3][5].

## Knight (N)

Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically) and then one square perpendicular to that[1][3]. They are the only pieces that can jump over other pieces[1][4].

## Bishop (B)

Bishops move diagonally any number of squares, provided there are no obstructions along their path[1][3][5].

## Queen (Q)

The Queen combines the movement capabilities of the rook and bishop. It can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as long as there are no obstructions[1][3][5].

## King (K)

The King moves one square in any direction â€“ horizontally, vertically, or diagonally[1][3][5]. It also participates in a special move called "castling," which involves the King and a Rook[1].

It's important to note that pieces cannot move through other pieces (except for the Knight), and they can never move onto a square occupied by one of their own pieces[4]. However, they can capture opponent's pieces by moving to their square and replacing them[3][4].

## Chessboard Coordinates

1. The chessboard is divided into 64 squares, arranged in an 8x8 grid.

2. Each square has a unique coordinate consisting of a letter and a number:
   - Letters (a-h) represent the files (vertical columns), running from left to right.
   - Numbers (1-8) represent the ranks (horizontal rows), running from bottom to top.

3. For example, the bottom-left square is a1, while the top-right square is h8.

## Describing Moves

1. To describe a move, you typically write:
   - The piece being moved (except for pawns)
   - The starting square
   - The destination square

2. For example:
   - "Nf3 to g5" would be written as Nf3-g5 or simply Nf3g5
   - For pawn moves, you omit the piece identifier: e2-e4 or just e4

3. Captures are indicated with an "x":
   - Bxf7 means a Bishop captures a piece on f7

4. Special moves:
   - Castling kingside: O-O
   - Castling queenside: O-O-O
   - En passant capture: exd6 e.p.
   - Pawn promotion: e8=Q (pawn promotes to Queen on e8)

This notation system allows chess players to record and communicate moves efficiently, making it possible to analyze games, share strategies, and play correspondence chess.
